Your task is to take a brief input and transform it into a rich, cinematic, immersive prompt that strictly adheres to a first-person perspective, making the viewer feel as if they are physically present in the scene.\nThis is the short prompt idea you need to expand upon: {{ $json.response.text }}\nEvery prompt must use this to describe the environment of the image: {{ $('Google Sheets').item.json['environment_prompt '] }}\nEvery prompt has two sections:\n1/ In the foreground, show and describe the hands, limbs, or feet of the viewer. must start with \"First person view POV GoPro shot of [relevant limb]...\"\n2/ In the background, describe the scenery. must start with \"In the background, [describe scenery]\"\nMost Important Guidelines:\nEvery image must be a first-person perspective shot-the viewer must feel like they are experiencing the moment themselves, not just observing it.\nA visible limb (hands or feet) must always be present and actively engaged in the environment-whether gripping, reaching, pushing, lifting, or interacting in a natural way.\nThe framing must be dynamic and interactive, mimicking real-world human vision-ensuring motion, depth, and immersion similar to a GoPro or head-mounted camera shot.\nOther Key Guidelines:\nFull-body awareness: The prompt should subtly remind the viewer that they have a physical presence-mentioning sensations like weight shifting, breath fogging in the cold, or fingers trembling from adrenaline.\nSensory depth: The prompt should engage multiple senses (sight, touch, temperature, sound, even smell) to heighten realism. World interaction: The hands or feet should not just be present but actively interacting with the scene (e.g., clutching, adjusting, stepping forward, brushing against surfaces).\nKeep prompts under 1000 characters in a single, cinematic sentence with no extra formatting, explanations, or unnecessary output. Examples:\nInput: Climbing a fire escape over neon streets\nOutput: POV of gloved hands straining to pull up against the slick, rusted fire escape ladder, neon lights dancing in the puddles below, cold rain sliding down trembling fingers, distant sirens wailing as my breath fogs the damp air, a rooftop edge just within reach.\n\nInput: Reaching for a coffee in a bustling caf√©\nOutput: POV of my outstretched hand wrapping around a steaming mug, heat radiating through the ceramic, the barista's tattooed arm extending the cup towards me, the chatter of morning rush echoing off tiled walls, sunlight catching floating dust as the rich aroma of espresso fills my breath.\nInput: Waking up in a medieval tavern\nOutput: POV of my rough, calloused hands rubbing heavy eyes, the flickering candlelight warping shadows on wooden beams, my fingers tracing the sweat-soaked grooves of a tankard, the thick scent of ale and smoke clinging to the air, muffled laughter and the distant pluck of a lute stirring my senses awake.\n"},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainLlm","typeVersion":1.5,"position":[560,-240],"id":"7ae8d600-8ade-4df4-9481-5f96507e79fd","name":"Generate Prompt"},{"parameters":{"content":"## | Generate Prompt","height":360,"width":480},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote","typeVersion":1,"position":[520,-300],"id":"a3cb68da-7f6b-4989-8368-64002e69a083","name":"Sticky Note1"},{"parameters":{"modelName":"models/gemini-2.0-flash","options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatGoogleGemini","typeVersion":1,"position":[580,-80],"id":"1d8ba376-4a44-4d1a-a461-79dff35cabb3","name":"Google Gemini Generate Prompt","credentials":{"googlePalmApi":{"id":"odIMe3IAUWSvrXkc","name":"Google Gemini(PaLM) API Account"}}},{"parameters":{"modelName":"models/gemini-2.0-flash","options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatGoogleGemini","typeVersion":1,"position":[80,160],"id":"3a18c017-c062-4825-895d-a6b46714b57c","name":"Google Gemini Generate Title","credentials":{"googlePalmApi":{"id":"odIMe3IAUWSvrXkc","name":"Google Gemini(PaLM) API Account"}}},{"parameters":{"content":"## |Generate Image","height":240,"width":480},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote","typeVersion":1,"position":[520,120],"id":"62c54199-4608-4c8f-ae29-0ef16389d0bf","name":"Sticky Note2"},{"parameters":{"method":"POST","url":"https://api.piapi.ai/api/v1/task","sendHeaders":true,"headerParameters":{"parameters":[{"name":"X-API-Key","value":"099aea4fa25ec8d3c36cae7c0bae42f97bada45d92f2ffe6c50748bec1716c64"}]},"sendBody":true,"contentType":"raw","rawContentType":"application/json","body":"={\n    \"model\": \"Qubico/flux1-dev\",\n    \"task type\": \"txt2img\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"prompt\": \"cute cat image with doremon\",\n        \"width\": 540,\n        \"height\": 960\n    }\n}","options":{}},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest","typeVersion":4.2,"position":[560,200],"id":"016b40f6-ba25-43bd-a60c-8030c73dbf91","name":"HTTP Request"}],"connections":{"Schedule Trigger":{"main":[[{"node":"Google Sheets","type":"main","index":0}]]},"Google Sheets":{"main":[[{"node":"Generate Titles","type":"main","index":0}]]},"Item List Output Parser":{"ai_outputParser":[[{"node":"Generate Titles","type":"ai_outputParser","index":0}]]},"Generate Titles":{"main":[[{"node":"Generate Prompt","type":"main","index":0}]]},"Google Gemini Generate Prompt":{"ai_languageModel":[[{"node":"Generate Prompt","type":"ai_languageModel","index":0}]]},"Google Gemini Generate Title":{"ai_languageModel":[[{"node":"Generate Titles","type":"ai_languageModel","index":0}]]},"Generate Prompt":{"main":[[{"node":"HTTP Request","type":"main","index":0}]]}},"settings":{"executionOrder":"v1"},"staticData":null,"meta":{"templateCredsSetupCompleted":true},"pinData":{},"versionId":"0ffd6bb5-f061-4f46-9ebc-38d025f32784","triggerCount":0,"tags":[]}
